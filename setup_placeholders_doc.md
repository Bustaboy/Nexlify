# Setup Script Remaining Placeholders Documentation

## Overview
The enhanced `setup_nexlify.py` script addresses all critical V3 improvements. All user configuration is now managed through the GUI, eliminating the need for manual file editing.

## System-Generated Configuration

### 1. System Secrets (.env file)
**Location**: `.env` file (auto-generated, do not edit)
**Contents**:
- `MASTER_PASSWORD`: System-generated encryption key
- `JWT_SECRET`: System-generated JWT signing key
- `MOBILE_API_SECRET`: System-generated mobile API key
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Docker PostgreSQL password
- `REDIS_PASSWORD`: Docker Redis password
- `SYSTEM_ID`: Unique system identifier

**Note**: These are all auto-generated and should never be manually edited.

### 2. User Configuration (via GUI)
All user settings are configured through the GUI and stored in `enhanced_config.json`:

#### Exchange Credentials
- Configured in Settings → Exchanges tab
- API keys and secrets entered securely
- Credentials encrypted before storage

#### Notification Services
- Configured in Settings → Notifications tab
- Telegram bot token and chat ID
- Email SMTP settings
- Webhook URLs

#### DeFi/RPC Settings
- Configured in Settings → DeFi tab
- Ethereum RPC URL (Alchemy/Infura)
- Private key for DeFi operations
- Gas and slippage settings

#### AI Companion
- Configured in Settings → AI tab
- OpenAI API key
- Model selection
- Personality settings

## No Manual Configuration Required

Unlike traditional setups, Nexlify v2.0.8 requires NO manual configuration:

1. **Run setup**: `python setup_nexlify.py`
2. **Start system**: `python smart_launcher.py`
3. **Configure via GUI**: All settings managed through the interface

The system guides users through:
- First-time PIN setup
- Exchange API configuration
- Optional service setup (notifications, AI, DeFi)
- Security configuration (2FA, IP whitelist)

All placeholders are eliminated - the GUI provides a secure, user-friendly way to configure everything.
