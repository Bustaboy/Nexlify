## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

- ✅ Set a strong PIN (not sequential or repeated digits)
- ✅ Use API keys with minimum required permissions
- ✅ Test thoroughly on testnet before mainnet
- ✅ Keep `config/neural_config.json` out of version control
- ✅ Enable integrity monitoring for critical files
- ✅ Set up Telegram notifications for alerts
- ✅ Regularly backup your configuration and database
- ✅ Monitor logs for unusual activity

## 📊 Performance Tracking

The system automatically tracks:
- Trade history and P&L
- Win rate and average profit
- Sharpe ratio calculation
- Maximum drawdown
- Fee analysis
- Exchange performance comparison

Data is stored in `data/trading.db` (SQLite) and can be exported to JSON/CSV.

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Test Suite
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_risk_manager.py

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=. tests/
```

### Backtest Mode
Use testnet mode on exchanges to validate strategies without real funds.

## 📈 Monitoring

### View Logs
```bash
# Real-time logs
tail -f logs/neural_net.log

# Search logs for errors
grep ERROR logs/neural_net.log
```

### Check System Health
```bash
# API health check
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health

# Database query
sqlite3 data/trading.db "SELECT * FROM trades ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10"
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| GUI won't start | Ensure all dependencies installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| No pairs showing | Wait 5 minutes for initial market scan |
| API errors | Verify API keys in API CONFIG tab |
| Can't login | Reset PIN in `config/neural_config.json` |
| Database locked | Close any duplicate running instances |
| High CPU usage | Reduce scan frequency in settings |
