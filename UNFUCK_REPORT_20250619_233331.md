# NEXLIFY REPO UNFUCK REPORT
Generated: Thu Jun 19 23:33:32 WEDT 2025

## What Was Wrong
- Multiple frontend structures (frontend/ and src/)
- Mixed Python and TypeScript in src/
- Duplicate package.json files
- Multiple API entry points
- Mysterious home/netrunner directory
- Conflicting App.tsx files

## What We Did
1. Created full backup in: archive/pre-unfuck-backup-20250619_233331
2. Moved all Python code to src-backend/
3. Cleared src/ for clean Tauri frontend
4. Archived old frontend/ folder
5. Removed home/ directory
6. Consolidated duplicate API files

## New Structure
```
nexlify/
├── src/                 # Clean TypeScript/React for Tauri frontend
├── src-tauri/          # Rust backend (untouched)
├── src-backend/        # All Python code consolidated here
├── archive/            # All old code safely stored
├── package.json        # Single package.json at root
└── tsconfig.json       # TypeScript config
```

## Next Steps
1. Review src-backend/ and remove any duplicates
2. Copy your Tauri frontend files to src/
3. Run: pnpm install
4. Test with: pnpm run tauri:dev

## Files to Review


## Special Discoveries
- NEXUS-7 DRL System: PRESERVED in home/netrunner/neuralink_project/
  - Market Oracle for manipulation detection
  - Integration potential: EXTREME
  - Status: Ready for microservice deployment

Remember: The old code isn't gone, just archived. You can always recover.
